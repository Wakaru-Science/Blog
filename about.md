Wakaru : To understand.

Feynman Quote on tools

This is my way of rethinking all the tools I currently posess.

If you keep knowledge to yourself, it becomes fragile and brittle. 

True strength is obtained under the fire of a hammer.

To strike yourself at your weakest understanding is not craziness but love.

To stand ground when your heart falters in the face of great uncertainity.

To believe in your logic when thousand paths lie ahead.

To put a step forward eventhough it leads to certain doom.

For everything is cargo cult science,

When science is not done for the sake of science.

The flower of science blooms midst the heat of battle. The clash of two pure passions.

I invite you to take a look at the contents of my brain.

And hammer it unhesitantly without any boundaries of Nationality and Elite Gated Institutions.

Thank you for yout time!
